#### Data Visualization
In this operation we have tried to visualize the data with different graphs and try to do some data mining.

#### Data Preprocessing

In this operation we have tried to compare the salary with the department and years of experience.

#### Model Building 
In, this step we have tried to do the model or train some data which we are going to use in the futre decesion tree operation.

#### Decision Tree

In, this step we have tried to predict the chances for employees to be in the organisation or leave the organisation.
