# Assignment-6-Binary-Classification-Breast-Cancer

### What is Binary Classification of Breast Cancer?

Breast Cancer is a cancer that devlops from breast cancer. Breast Cancer may include lumps in breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from th nipples etc. Breast cancer may be devloped due to lack of physcical excercise, alcoholism, hormon replacement therapy during menopause, having child late in life or not at all.

### Problem Statement:

The Problem in hand is a binay classification in which we are going to compile the data from the data.csv file and try to analyze the result. This binary classification cointains a lot of characteristics of tissue culture like radius,smoothness, texture, smoothness etc. While the output is binary.

In, this project our aim is to try to understand the features, execute some strategies for feature reduction, apply a binary classification algorithm until performance saturates.

### About Dataset:

Here, for this project we have used a file named Data.csv. In this file we have 569 rows and 33 columns. Out of the 33 colums the first two colums includes Id and diagnosis. Some of the top ten features of are:

* Radius
* Concavity
* Texture
* Smoothness
* Symmetry
* compactness
* concave points
* Area
* Fractal dimension
* Perimeter













## Applications Used:

**Python: 3.10.2**

**Jyputer Notebook: 6.1.5**


## Libraries Used:

**Numpy: 1.19.0** 

**Matplotlib: 3.6.2**

**Seaborn: 0.12**

**Pandas: 1.5.1**

## Sample Data Taken:

**data.csv**

## Operations:

#### Numerical Analysis

In this Operation we have inserted the department and salary data. Done merging and joining employee id with employee index. and tried to find the sum and mean of the data.

#### Data Visualization
In this operation we have tried to visualize the data with different graphs and try to do some data mining.

#### Data Preprocessing

In this operation we have tried to compare the salary with the department and years of experience.

#### Model Building 
In, this step we have tried to do the model or train some data which we are going to use in the futre decesion tree operation.

#### Decision Tree

In, this step we have tried to predict the chances for employees to be in the organisation or leave the organisation.
